This chapter is going to list some learning outcomes by using SNAP and process sensor related data using R. All shows below.\nWhen I first came to SNAP, it is totally a strange thing for me. After loading the zip file and converted to default RGB filed, the area I chose looks like this Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: snap_rgb_loadded\n\n\nJust follow the work steps one by one, let’s do it.\nLoad the London ward shapefile for masking"
