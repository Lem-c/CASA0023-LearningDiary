# 03 Data Fusion: Principles and Methods

# Summary

Data Fusion, originally used in military domains, is now a critical part of various fields including multi-source image composition, robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles, image analysis, and more. It involves the integration of multi-source remote sensing image data, enhancing the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data interpretation.

## Principles and Process of Data Fusion

Data fusion in remote sensing images typically follows a two-step process:

### 1. Preprocessing

Involves geometric correction, atmospheric correction, radiometric correction, and spatial registration of remote sensing images.

### 2. Data Fusion

Selecting suitable fusion algorithms based on the purpose and level of fusion to synthesize spatially registered data or extracted features, leading to more accurate target representation or estimation.

## Classification and Methods of Data Fusion

Data fusion methods for remote sensing images are categorized into:

-   Pixel-level Fusion: A low-level fusion maintaining high accuracy but with limitations in efficiency and analysis capability.

-   Feature-level Fusion: A medium-level fusion focusing on extracting and integrating features from different sources.

-   Decision-level Fusion: The highest level of fusion providing strong fault tolerance and requiring high processing capabilities.

Various data fusion methods include algebraic methods, image regression, principal component transformation (PCT), K-T transformation, wavelet transformation, and IHS transformation.
