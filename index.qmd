Hi, it's Yohao (Yuhao Chen in chinese PinYin) here, you can also call me Lem. Feel free to call me Lem, a nickname I picked up while playing a video game I love, Counter Strike. Born in a small town surrounded by mountains on three sides in northwest China, I'm quite interested in hiking and finding beautify things in life, which inspired me to take photographs.
