Characteristics of multi-sources remote sensing data include:\n\nRedundancy: Multiple sources providing similar information about the environment or targets.\nComplementarity: Information from different and independent sources.\nCooperativeness: Dependence among different sensors in observation and processing.\nHierarchical Structure: Data fusion handles information at various levels, such as pixel, feature, and decision levels, ensuring system real-time capabilities."

Major developments need an energy strategy to reduce internal overheating and air conditioning reliance, following a cooling hierarchy that prioritizes:\n\n\nReducing heat entry via orientation, shading, and insulation.\nMinimizing internal heat through efficient design.\nManaging internal heat with thermal mass and high ceilings.\nEnabling passive ventilation, followed by mechanical ventilation.\nConsidering active cooling systems only as a last resort.\n\nClimate change has heightened London’s temperature, exacerbating the urban heat island effect and health risks during extreme heat. New developments must address citywide and building-specific overheating. Strategies include avoiding excessive glazing and promoting passive ventilation. Air conditioning, which contributes to urban heat, should be minimized. The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) provides guidelines for addressing overheating in new and refurbished buildings, ensuring designs are future-proof against climate change.\n\n5.4.1.1 Landsat pre-processing steps\nIncluded: (i) image resampling, (ii) conversion of raw digital values (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, (iii) cloud/shadow/water screening and quality assessment (QA), and (iv) image normalization”\n\n\n5.4.1.2 Decision trees\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Case study\n\nForest fires\n\n\n\n\n\nAbercrombie, Patrick. 1944.
