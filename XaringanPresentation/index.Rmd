# Introduction to SNAP and Sensor Waves

- Welcome to our presentation on SNAP and Sensor Waves.

---

# Light and Different Kinds of Waves

- Let's start by understanding light and the various types of waves in the world.

- Light is an electromagnetic wave and is just one type among many others.
  
### Types of Waves
- Electromagnetic Waves:
  - Visible light
  - Infrared
  - Ultraviolet
  - Radio waves
  - Microwaves
  - X-rays
- Mechanical Waves:
  - Sound waves

# SNAP in Processing Sentinel Data

- SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) is a powerful tool for processing Sentinel satellite data.

- It provides a range of functions for data pre-processing, analysis, and visualization.


##  SNAP Features

- SNAP Features:
  - Data pre-processing
  - Atmospheric correction
  - Image filtering
  - Image fusion
  - Data visualization

---

# Benefits of SNAP

- SNAP is an open-source platform.

- It is user-friendly and provides a graphical interface.

- Offers support for a variety of remote sensing data formats.

---

# Conclusion

- In this presentation, we explored the world of sensor waves, including light and various wave types.
- We also introduced SNAP and its significance in processing Sentinel data.
