This chapter is going to list some learning outcomes by using SNAP and process sensor related data using R. All shows below.\nWhen I first came to SNAP, it is totally a strange thing for me. After loading the zip file and converted to default RGB filed, the area I chose looks like this Figure 1.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: snap_rgb_loadded\n\n\nJust follow the work steps one by one, let’s do it.\nLoad the London ward shapefile for masking"

    "text": "3.2 1. Basic Concept of Data Fusion\nData fusion integrates diverse and redundant information from multiple sources to provide a more accurate, complete, and reliable estimate or judgment than single-source data. Characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data include:\n\nRedundancy: Multiple sources providing similar information about the environment or targets.\nComplementarity: Information from different and independent sources.\nCooperativeness: Dependence among different sensors in observation and processing.\nHierarchical Structure: Data fusion handles information at various levels, such as pixel, feature, and decision levels, ensuring system real-time capabilities."
