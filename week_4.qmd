# Policy Applications

## Data from sensors

-   Identify what kind of data to get full use of it

## Land use and Land cover (LULC)

-   Access to green space

    -   shortest distance/...

## Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

-   Active sensors

-   Reflection with surface texture data

-   See through weather and clouds

#### SAR polarization and background

Electromagnetic spectrum (EMR)

A SAR signal has both amplitude (backscatter) and phase data.

-   Windy and CALM: water move

#### More SAR

-   SAR Floods

-   Drawback? (Me on SAR)

-   Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)

## Application

### London Plan

-   Policy SI 4 Managing heat risk [@abercrombie1944greater]

#### Landsat pre-processing steps

Included: (i) image resampling, (ii) conversion of raw digital values (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, (iii) cloud/shadow/water screening and quality assessment (QA), and (iv) image normalization"

#### Decision trees

### Case study

-   Forest fires
