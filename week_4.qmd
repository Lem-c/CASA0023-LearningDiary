# Policy Applications

## Data from sensors

-   Identify what kind of data to get full use of it

## Land use and Land cover (LULC)

-   Access to green space

    -   shortest distance/...

## Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

-   Active sensors

-   Reflection with surface texture data

-   See through weather and clouds

#### SAR polarization and background

Electromagnetic spectrum (EMR)

A SAR signal has both amplitude (backscatter) and phase data.

-   Windy and CALM: water move

#### More SAR

-   SAR Floods

-   Drawback? (Me on SAR)

-   Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)

## Application

### London Plan

-   Policy SI 4 Managing heat risk [@abercrombie1944greater] p354

-   Urban development proposals must mitigate the urban heat island effect through thoughtful **design, materials, and green infrastructure**. Major developments need an **energy strategy** to reduce internal overheating and air conditioning reliance, following a cooling hierarchy that prioritizes:

1.  **Reducing heat entry** via orientation, shading, and insulation.
2.  **Minimizing internal heat** through efficient design.
3.  **Managing internal heat** with thermal mass and high ceilings.
4.  **Enabling passive ventilation**, followed by mechanical ventilation.
5.  **Considering active cooling systems** only as a last resort.

Climate change has heightened London's temperature, exacerbating the urban heat island effect and health risks during extreme heat. New developments must address citywide and building-specific overheating. Strategies include avoiding excessive glazing and promoting passive ventilation. Air conditioning, which contributes to urban heat, should be minimized. The **Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE)** provides guidelines for addressing overheating in new and refurbished buildings, ensuring designs are future-proof against climate change.
